The system operates with two water intakes—**warm surface seawater** and **cold deep seawater**—that drive both power generation and desalination processes.  
A **Hybrid OTEC Controller** manages flow between the open-cycle (freshwater) and closed-cycle (electricity) subsystems.

## System Explanation

### 🔹 Source of Energy
The **Ocean Thermal Gradient (OTG)** serves as the energy source, using the **temperature difference** between warm surface water (≈25–28 °C) and cold deep water (≈5–8 °C).  
This stable, natural gradient enables **continuous base-load power generation**, available 24/7 in tropical regions.

### 🔹 Conversion Process

The **Hybrid OTEC System** integrates two complementary cycles:

- **Freshwater Loop (Open-Cycle Element):**  
  Warm seawater is pumped into a **Flash Evaporator** under vacuum, where part of it **boils instantly** to form **low-pressure steam**, leaving salts behind.  
  This steam is condensed by **cold deep seawater**, producing **pure freshwater**.

- **Electricity Loop (Closed-Cycle Element):**  
  The low-pressure steam also acts as a **heat source** for a secondary working fluid, typically **ammonia**, within a **Heat Exchanger (Evaporator)**.  
  The ammonia vapor expands through a **Turbine–Generator**, generating **electric power**.  
  The vapor is then **condensed** by the cold deep seawater and **recirculated** by a pump, forming a continuous **Rankine cycle**.

### 🔹 Output / Utilization

The system yields **three major outputs:**

1. **Electrical Power** – Stable, continuous **AC electricity** from the turbine generator, ideal for island microgrids or coastal infrastructure.  
2. **Freshwater** – High-purity **desalinated water** from the open-cycle condenser, usable for **drinking**, **irrigation**, and **industrial** purposes.  
3. **Cold Water By-product** – Residual deep seawater can be utilized for:  
   - **Seawater Air Conditioning (SWAC)**  
   - **Aquaculture / Mariculture**  
   - **Industrial cooling applications**

### 🔹 Real-World Application Relevance

**Hybrid OTEC systems** are especially valuable for **tropical island nations** and **coastal regions** that face challenges of limited freshwater and dependence on imported fossil fuels.

**Key benefits include:**
- Provides **base-load renewable power** (unlike solar or wind).  
- Produces **desalinated water** without separate energy-intensive processes.  
- Supports **Blue Economy initiatives** by enabling energy–water–food security.  
- Operates continuously with **minimal environmental impact**.

**Examples:**  
- Hawaii (USA), Japan, India, and small Pacific island states have developed or piloted OTEC systems.  
- Demonstrated scalability for communities requiring **energy + water co-production**.
